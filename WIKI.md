## Google OAuth 2.0 Set Up
[OAuth2.0 Guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2UserAgent?hl=en_US)
- implicit grant flow: only authorized while using app. does not store info.
- requirements
 - API key: for identification
 - OAuth Client id: for authorization
- flow
 - user clicks `authorize` button in web app
 - redirected to google url (request includes authentication parameters: client id, name, etc.)
 - google redirects back to webapp and includes access token in response
 - app verifies access token
 - app requests user info
 - use Google's OAuth client libraries instead of writing own
- identify access scopes:
 - read tasks
 - write completed tasks
- authorized JS origins and redirects
- consent screen
 - identity of data requester
 - scopes requested
- exposing client id and api key
 - unavoidable but must restrict referer/origin urls (So that other ppl won't be able to use my exposed info to make requests)
