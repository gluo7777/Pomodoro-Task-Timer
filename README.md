# Background
I use apps like timer-tab.com, Google Tasks (and iOS apps) a lot and would like to integrate these functionalities, mainly for my own use cases and learning.

# Goal
While design is important, I want to focus on the functionality and therefore will try to make the app very responsive and durable. I will start off with Javascript, but will explore AngularJS and ReactJS, etc.

# Approach
While I'm not completely new to front end concepts, I want to break down the development process into small research spikes that will produce demo components. Once I feel that I have enough components to address the minimum requirements I set out to create, I will integrate these components and make my first implementation.

# Action Items
